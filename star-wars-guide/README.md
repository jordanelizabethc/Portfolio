# Star Wars: A Visual Guide
![Star Wars App Website](https://sarvey-webdev.com/assets/img/starwars.jpg)

I built this app as a capstone project for the Frontend Development Course at [Thinkful.com](https://www.thinkful.com/). I utilized the
[Star Wars API](http://swapi.co/) (SWAPI) to pull in data about Star Wars characters, films, species, starships, vehicles, and planets. I
built the app using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Lumx](http://ui.lumapps.com/).
